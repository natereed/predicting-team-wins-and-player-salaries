# Predicting Baseball Player Salaries and Team Wins
# Nate Reed

---

# Problem

* Could we predict free agent salaries?
* Hypothesis: Player salaries are determined by on-field performance

---

# Approach

* Assemble prior year(s) playing data and salaries (2011-2015) into Observations.csv
* Add features for career playing stats (Batting averages, earned runs, innings pitched, etc)
* Use regression with 5-Fold Cross-Validation
* Eliminate features (regularization, RFE, manual)

---

# Exploratory Analysis

* Understand distribution of salaries
* Explored relationships between various stats and salaries
* df.corr() and seaborn scatterplots

# Feature Selection

* Automated techniques: Ridge, LASSO, ElasticNet, RFE
* Manual (statsmodels): Eliminate variables with high p-values

Simplified OLS model:

    Adjusted Salary = 0.15 + 3.29 * Batting_Career_TB - 0.32 * Pitching_Career_IP 
      + 6.3 * Pitching_Career_SO + 3.22 * Num_All_Star_Appearances - 0.34 * NO_POSITION 
      + 0.2 * FIRST_BASE + 0.4 * SECOND_BASE

# Most Important Drivers of Compensation

* TB (Total Bases): Number of bases by hits
* SO (Strikeouts): Number of times pitcher struck out opposing batter
* Number of All-Star Appearances
* Position played

---

# Team Wins

Linear regression with team statistics as predictors and winning percentage as the response 
variable:

    WPCT = 0.45 + 0.79 * R - 0.36 * AB - 0.02 * THIRD_BASE_HITS 
      - 0.05 * HR - 0.04 * BB - 0.04 * SB - 0.01 * SF - 0.63 * RA 
      + 0.36 * ER - 0.32 * ERA + 0.07 * CG + 0.03 * SHO + 0.11 * SV 
      + 0.06 * E + 0.18 * FP + 0.01 * BPF - 0.01 * PPF

R^2 = 0.9

R (Runs) has the largest coefficient by magnitude, followed by RA (Runs Allowed).

---

# Recommendations:

* Model could be used to obtain "ballpark" estimate of salary (not very accurate)
* Runs drive wins, but base hits is only one way to get on base
* Some skills may be overvalued (eg. hitting)
* Use On-Base Percentage (OBP) instead of TB: Includes walks, hit by pitcher
